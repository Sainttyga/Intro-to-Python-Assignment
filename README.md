# 🧮 Simple Python Calculator

## 📌 Description
This is a basic Python calculator program that allows users to perform simple arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). The user inputs two numbers and an operator, and the program calculates and displays the result.

## 🚀 Features
- Supports **addition (+)**, **subtraction (-)**, **multiplication (*)**, and **division (/)**.
- Handles **division by zero** gracefully.
- Accepts **floating-point numbers** for accurate calculations.
- Provides **error handling** for invalid operations.

## 📜 How to Use
1. Run the Python script.
2. Enter the first number.
3. Enter the second number.
4. Enter a mathematical operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`).
5. View the calculated result.

## 🔧 Example Usage
```bash
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Enter an operation (+, -, *, /): +
10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0
```

## 🖥️ Code
```python
# Simple Calculator Program

# Get user input
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
operation = input("Enter an operation (+, -, *, /): ")

# Perform the calculation
if operation == "+":
    result = num1 + num2
    print(f"{num1} + {num2} = {result}")
elif operation == "-":
    result = num1 - num2
    print(f"{num1} - {num2} = {result}")
elif operation == "*":
    result = num1 * num2
    print(f"{num1} * {num2} = {result}")
elif operation == "/":
    if num2 != 0:  # Check for division by zero
        result = num1 / num2
        print(f"{num1} / {num2} = {result}")
    else:
        print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed!")
else:
    print("Invalid operation! Please enter +, -, *, or /.")
```
